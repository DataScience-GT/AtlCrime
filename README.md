# AtlCrime

This serves as the official development branch of DSGT. 

Instructions for getting started: 

1. Clone the repository 
2. link the pre-shared "data" folder into the repository, so the new structure is as depicted: 
   ```
    AtlCrime/ 
        data/ 
           file1... 
        Crime.ipynb 
        data.json 
        index.html 
        overlay.js 
        ```
 3. Startup jupyter notebook 
 4. Get to work! 
 
 
## Notes
The compiled JSON file is pulled from the statement d3.json(...) in overlay.js. This may change based on where the project goes.
