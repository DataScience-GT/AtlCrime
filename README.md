# AtlCrime

This serves as the official development branch of DSGT.

Instructions for getting started:

1. Clone the repository
2. Repo is structured as below. Data is contained in data folder

## Fun Facts

- Different Jupyter notebooks are contained under notebooks. Lots of data exploration can be seen in the spring2018 notebooks, fall2018 has more around modeling the data with point process models, etc.
- A website visualization is also included in public

## What you need that's not here

- credentials.json: a json file with our firebase RSA key. Ask someone on team or email Will Epperson for this
- Different python packages are needed for different notebooks
